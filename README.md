# twimgdump

Just because you've liked or retweeted a piece of media on Twitter doesn't mean that it will still be there tomorrow.
The author might suddenly become permanently suspended.  Or they might have a lapse in judgment and irrevocably
delete a bunch of their old tweets.  Or they might be "canceled" for Americentric ideological reasons and be bullied
into deleting tweets deemed inappropriate.  Whatever the reason may be, the point is: if you like a user's uploaded
media, you probably want to take local copies of them.

twimgdump is a small command-line tool I developed to help me make local copies of art uploaded by artists I follow on
Twitter.  It fetches all tweets posted to a Twitter user's media timeline and saves the attached photos, videos and
GIFs to disk.

## Usage

```
Usage:
  twimgdump [options] [--] <user-screen-name>

Options:
  -c, --cursor <cursor>
    Set the initial cursor value.

  -h, --help
    Display this help text.

  -o, --output <output-file-path-template>
    Set the template used to determine the output file paths of
    downloaded media.  The tokens '[userId]', '[username]', '[tweetId]',
    '[created]', '[count]', '[mediaId]', '[index]', '[baseName]',
    '[extension]', '[width]' and '[height]' will be substituted by the
    attributes of retrieved media.  If not specified, the default
    template '[username]/[tweetId]+[index].[extension]' will be used.

  -V, --version
    Display the version number.
```

## Features

* Downloads all photos, videos and GIFs (read: also videos) from a Twitter user's media timeline using the highest
  resolution and quality options available.
* Uses the API the twitter.com website itself uses, meaning that no authentication or API keys are required.
* **New:** Offers granular control over the output file path of downloaded media using file path templates like
`[username]/[tweetId]/[baseName]_[width]x[height].[extension]`.
* Supports downloading media from profiles marked as containing sensitive content.

## Limitations

* Only downloads media from a specific user; does not support downloading media matching an arbitrary search query.
* Very brittle; the program may terminate unexpectedly upon receiving non-successful or malformed responses.
* Does not currently handle rate limiting at all (though this usually won't be a problem unless you're downloading a
  massive amount of media).
* Does not currently support downloading media from protected profiles.
* **Will** break if Twitter makes sudden changes to their API.

## Dependencies

* .NET Core 3.1

## Building

```
dotnet build [-c Release]
```
