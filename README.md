# twimgdump

Just because you've liked or retweeted a piece of media on Twitter doesn't mean that it will still be there tomorrow.
The author might suddenly become permanently suspended.  Or they might have a lapse in judgment and irrevocably
delete a bunch of their old tweets.  Or they might be "canceled" for Americentric ideological reasons and be bullied
into deleting tweets deemed inappropriate.  Whatever the reason may be, the point is: if you like a user's uploaded
media, you probably want to take local copies of them.

twimgdump is a small command-line tool I developed to help me make local copies of art uploaded by artists I follow on
Twitter.  It fetches all tweets posted to a Twitter user's media timeline and saves the attached photos, videos and
GIFs to disk.

## Usage

```
Usage:
  twimgdump [options] [--] <user-screen-name>

Options:
  -c, --cursor <cursor>            Set the initial cursor value.
  -h, --help                       Display this help text.
  -o, --output <output-directory>  Set the output directory.
  -V, --version                    Display the version number.
```

## Features

* Downloads all photos, videos and GIFs (read: also videos) from a Twitter user's media timeline.
* Uses the API the twitter.com website itself uses, meaning that no authentication or API keys are required.
* Encodes the ID of the tweets in the names of downloaded files for easy reverse lookup.
* Supports downloading media from profiles marked as containing sensitive content.

## Limitations

* Only downloads media from a specific user; does not support downloading media matching an arbitrary search query.
* Very brittle; the program may terminate unexpectedly upon receiving non-successful or malformed responses.
* Does not currently handle rate limits at all (though this usually won't be a problem unless you're downloading a
  massive amount of media).
* Does not currently support downloading media from protected profiles.
* **Will** break if Twitter makes sudden changes to their API.

## Dependencies

* .NET Core 3.1

## Building

```
dotnet build [-c Release]
